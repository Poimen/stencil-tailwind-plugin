# stencil-tailwind-plugin

This package is used to integrate [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) and (StencilJS)[https://stenciljs.com/]. This plugin for Stencil is specifically focused on the integration between tailwindcss in [JIT](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/just-in-time-mode#enabling-jit-mode) mode and the Stencil build. While tailwindcss can be integrated into a Stencil build, this plugin aims to ease the integration, while providing an optimised inclusion of styles across the shadow DOM.

This plugin also aims to allow users to make use of all the tailwindcss classes and postcss plugins like (@apply)[https://tailwindcss.com/docs/functions-and-directives#apply]. In such both styles of tailwindcss usage can be used in a single component. This plugin also aims to allow the use of object initialisers to conditionally set styles.

## Getting started

This guide assumes that a Stencil project has already been initialized and configured.

## Honourable mentions

A lot of inspiration for this plugin was taken from the similarly named plugin, (stencil-tailwind)[https://github.com/jrowlingson/stencil-tailwind] by *Jack Rowlingson*.

Inspiration also taken from (proto-stencil-tailwind)[https://github.com/eswat2/proto-stencil-tailwind] that moves stencil-tailwind forward by *Richard Hess*.

Special thanks to the above.
